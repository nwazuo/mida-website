Website and CMS for Mida agency. 


## Guidelines

**Don't hardcode website copy/text in code**
There's a `src/data` folder for situating common pieces of data for website content in as a JavaScript object. Other pieces of copy for the page should be authored in an object in the page's data fetching function. See index page for example
